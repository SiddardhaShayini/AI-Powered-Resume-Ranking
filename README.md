# AI-Powered Resume Ranking System

An intelligent resume screening and ranking system that uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically score and rank candidate resumes against job descriptions.

## 🎯 Overview

This application leverages SpaCy for NLP processing and scikit-learn for machine learning to provide comprehensive resume analysis. The system evaluates resumes based on keyword matching, skills assessment, experience evaluation, and semantic similarity using TF-IDF vectorization.

## ✨ Features

- **PDF Resume Processing**: Automatic text extraction from PDF resume files
- **Multi-factor Scoring**: Weighted algorithm considering keywords, skills, experience, and semantic similarity
- **Interactive Web Interface**: User-friendly Streamlit application
- **Real-time Analysis**: Instant resume ranking with detailed insights
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Downloadable HR reports in PDF format
- **Sample Data**: Built-in sample job descriptions and resumes for testing
- **Analytics Dashboard**: System performance metrics and trends
- **Detailed Insights**: Candidate-specific recommendations and analysis

## 🚀 Quick Start

## 📊 How It Works

### Scoring Methodology

The system uses a weighted multi-factor scoring algorithm:

- **Keyword Matching (30%)**: Direct keyword alignment between resume and job description
- **Skills Assessment (25%)**: Technical and soft skills matching using pattern recognition
- **Experience Evaluation (20%)**: Years of experience extraction and comparison
- **Semantic Similarity (25%)**: TF-IDF vectorization with cosine similarity for contextual matching
